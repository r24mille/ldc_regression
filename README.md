ldc_regression
==============

Linear regression analysis using hourly smart meter electricity data from a local distribution company (LDC). I'm using hierarchical group-LASSO for explanatory variable selection and using my results as input to others' models I've identified as prior work.

Later, I will be using these methods in a time-of-use (TOU) electricity pricing case study.


Work-in-Progress
================

This workspace is currently a bit messy with many comments/commits as notes to myself. I will clean things up quite a bit as I get closer to writing my thesis and having others review my work.
